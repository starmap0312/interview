# n-tier architecture
  1) a physical structuring mechanism for system infrastructure
     tier: physical structuring mechanism
     layer: logical structuring mechanism
  2) segregating an application into tiers: flexible and reusable
  3) three-tier architecture (client-server architecture)
     a) user interface / presentation tier (V)
        translate tasks and results to something user can understand
     b) application processing / domain logic tier (C)
        coordinates application, processes commands, makes logical decisions, evaluations
        moves and processes data between the other two layers
        ex. Ruby on Rails / Java EE / ASP.NET / PHP / Perl / Python / NodeJS
     c) data management / data storage tier (M)
        stores and retrieves information from a database or filesystem
  4) allow any of the tiers to be upgraded or replaced independently
  5) data transfer between tiers: SNMP / CORBA / JAVA RMI / sockets / UDP / web services
