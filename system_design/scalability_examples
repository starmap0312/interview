# HAProxy
  1) a high availability load balancer and a proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based
       applications that spreads requests across multiple servers
  2) written in C (efficient in terms of processor and memory)
  3) support HTTPS connections
     if users connect to port 80, HAProxy can send 301 Redirect to users

           (HTTP:443)         (HTTP:80)
     users ---------> HAProxy --------> real server
                              --------> real server

     HAProxy decodes the SSL packets and forward the decoded packets to real servers

# Nginx (pronounced "engine x")
  1) a web server
  2) a reverse proxy server for HTTP/HTTPS and SMTP/POP3/IMAP protocols
  3) a load balancer
  4) an HTTP cache

# Comparision of HAProxy and Nginx
  HAProxy: just a load balancer/reverse proxy
    a) TCP and HTTP proxying (SSL added from 1.5-dev12)
    b) more rate limiting options
  Nginx: a webserver that can also function as a reverse proxy
    a) supports SSL directly
    b) also a caching server

# Memcached
  1) high-performance, distributed memory object caching system
  2) used for speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load
  3) an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects)
     from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering
  4) its API is available for most popular languages

  ussage:

    function get_foo(foo_id)
      foo = memcached_get("foo:" . foo_id)
      return foo if defined foo

      foo = fetch_foo_from_database(foo_id)
      memcached_set("foo:" . foo_id, foo)
      return foo
    end

  telnet:

    telnet localhost 11211
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    get foo
    VALUE foo 0 2

# Redis
  summary:
  1) a data structure server, the most popular key-value database
  2) open-source, networked, in-memory, and stores keys with optional durability
  3) NoSQL database
  4) most languages have Redis bindings: ex. Java, C++, Python, Ruby, etc.
  
  data types:
  1) maps keys to types of values
  2) supports not only strings, but also abstract data types
     (the key difference with other structured storage)
     a) lists of strings
     b) sets of strings: collections of non-repeating unsorted elements
     c) sorted sets of strings: ordered by a floating-point number called score
     d) hash tables: keys and values are strings
     e) HyperLogLogs: used for approximated set cardinality size estimation
  3) supports high-level, atomic, server-side operations
     ex. intersection / union / difference between sets
         sorting of lists / sets / sorted sets

  persistence:
  1) holds the whole dataset in memory
  2) two different ways to achieve persistence
     a) snapshotting
        a semi-persistent durability mode where the dataset is asynchronously transferred from
        memory to disk from time to time (in RDB dump format)
     b) append-only file (AOF)
        an AOF (a journal) is written when modifying the dataset in memory
  3) Redis syncs data to the disk at least every 2 seconds

  replication:
  1) supports master-slave replication
     data from any Redis server can replicate to any number of slaves
  2) a slave may be a master to another slave: single-rooted replication tree

  performance:
  1) faster than database systems
     database systems write every change to disk before considering a transaction committed
  2) no speed difference between write and read operations
  3) Redis operates as a single process and is single-threaded
     a single Redis instance cannot utilize parallel execution of tasks

# Redis vs. Memcached
  Redis pros:
    1) extra database-features of Redis: ex. persistence
    2) built-in data structures: lists and sets
    3) a clever key'ing: may get completly rid of database
  Memcached pros:
    if just need to cache, take Memcached: it scales like a charm

# Lucene
  1) a information retrieval software library, an indexing and search library
  2) suitable for any application that requires full text indexing and searching capability
  3) recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local,
     single-site searching

# RabbitMQ
  1) a message-oriented middleware that implements Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
  2) written in Erlang
  3) messaging enables software applications to connect and scale
     applications can connect to each other, as components of a larger application
     asynchronous, decoupling applications by separating sending and receiving data

  Python sample programs: sending and receiving messages using a queue

  1) Sending: establishes a connection, sends a message and finally closes the connection

     import pika
     connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host='localhost'))
     channel = connection.channel()
     channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')
     channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World!')
     print " [x] Sent 'Hello World!'"
     connection.close()

  2) Receiving: receives messages from the queue and prints them on the screen

     import pika
     connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host='localhost'))
     channel = connection.channel()
     channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')
     print ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'
     def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
         print " [x] Received %r" % (body,)
     channel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello', no_ack=True)
     channel.start_consuming()

# Munin
  1) monitoring software application for system, network and infrastructure
  2) alerting services for servers, switches, applications, services, etc
  3) a master/nodes architecture in which the master connects to all the nodes at regular
     intervals and asks them for data. it then stores the data in RRD files, and (if needed)
     updates the graphs
  4) written in Perl

# NodeJS
  1) a cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications
  2) has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O

# real-life examples
  1) Twitter: real time feed of the tweets by the people you are following
  2) Google: instantly returning the pages matching any search query (Search)
             storing and serving massive amounts of video data (YouTube)
             aggregating the world news by topic (Google news)
  3) Facebook: serving massive amounts of photos
